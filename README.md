This is a simple steam cardbot.

It uses nodesteam and steam-tradeoffers.

This readme is sparse because I no longer maintain this bot.

In order to get the bot to work you must first generate a sentry file.
To generate simply run the bot once with an empty authcode and the shaSentryfile commented out. After this you will get an email with an authcode. Run the bot again with this authcode. It will generate a sentry file. You can use this sentry from now on with no authcode.
